    <h1>From Kitwe to Code: The Story of Deraka Miswalo</h1>
    <p>In the mining city of Kitwe, Zambia—where dusty roads meet copper dreams—a boy named Deraka Miswalo began a journey that would reshape not just his future, but the path for many others. Born in 2009 into a stable, average Zambian family—neither rich nor poor—Deraka grew up in a house filled with warmth, books, and the steady presence of his mother, a government school teacher.

        In 2012, tragedy struck when Deraka’s father passed away. His mother, now a widow with four children—two daughters, one son, and Deraka—stepped into the role of sole provider with strength and grace. While his siblings thrived in social spaces—sports fields, music groups, school clubs—Deraka was always a little different. Quiet. Focused. Curious. He was the one who would take apart broken electronics just to see what was inside.
        
        He began his education at Chachiwe Primary School, a modest but community-driven school not far from home. From his first years there, teachers noticed his hunger for knowledge. He wasn't just trying to pass—he wanted to understand. That same energy followed him when he was accepted into Chavuma Boarding Secondary School—far from home, but full of new possibilities.
        
        It was during this time, in 2021, that something powerful shifted inside him. While back home for a school break, he was given access to an old, barely functioning borrowed laptop from one of his mother’s colleagues. The keys were stiff, the battery barely held charge—but it worked. That’s all he needed.
        
        Using free online resources accessed through internet cafés, Deraka began teaching himself how to code. It started with the basics: HTML and CSS. But as the days went on, he dug deeper—JavaScript, databases, and the structure of real websites. No one around him was doing this. It was something entirely his own.
        
        Eventually, he transferred to Chati South Boarding School, where he remains today, continuing to build his knowledge while balancing academics and his passion for coding. At Chati South, he found students who were bright and capable, but often stuck—not because they lacked potential, but because they didn’t know what came next. Graduating from school didn’t guarantee access to higher education. Applications were confusing. Deadlines were missed. Scholarships were unknown. Many students simply gave up.
        
        Deraka couldn’t accept that.
        
        In late 2022, he started developing a solution—a digital platform he called BridgeWay. Its mission: to help students across Zambia access universities by providing clear, easy-to-navigate information. BridgeWay listed institutions, deadlines, scholarship options, and simple guides to applying. Everything was free, designed for students like him—ambitious, but underserved.
        
        He coded the entire project himself on that borrowed laptop, sometimes working by candlelight at school or during breaks. He researched every university he could find, copied deadlines, and built the site page by page. BridgeWay wasn’t flashy. But it worked.
        
        By mid-2023, BridgeWay had helped hundreds of Zambian students apply to colleges they hadn’t known about before. Teachers shared it. Guidance counselors printed it out. Classmates who once felt lost now had a map.
        
        And behind it all was a 14-year-old boy with a dream—not of fame, not of money—but of shaking hands with Mark Zuckerberg, his role model. To Deraka, Zuckerberg was proof that code, when paired with purpose, could change the world. Deraka didn’t want to build the next Facebook. He wanted to build the next opportunity.
        
        His siblings, still baffled by how long he spent glued to a laptop, began to admire what he was creating. His mother continued supporting him in the best way she could: by letting him dream, and never questioning his direction.
        
        Now 15 and still enrolled at Chati South, Deraka continues improving BridgeWay, tutoring classmates in coding basics, and speaking at school forums. He's still learning. Still growing. Still dreaming.
        
        When asked what keeps him going, his response carries the wisdom of someone far older than his age:
        
        “I don’t just want to be someone who made it out—I want to be someone who built a way through. If a thousand kids walk through that door after me, that’s what success looks like.”
        – Deraka Miswalo
        
        The boy from Kitwe may not have shaken Zuckerberg’s hand yet—but with each line of code, he reaches closer—not just to that handshake, but to a future where no Zambian student is left behind for lack of access.
